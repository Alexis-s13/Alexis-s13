# RAID Toolkit

`RAID Toolkit` is a companion application designed to be run alongside `RAID: Shadow Legends` and will provide additional features and aids to players.
***This is NOT built as a cheating application, and will never entertain providing capabilities which could not be accomplished without the tool.***

## Current features

### Mercy Shard Status
Tired of keeping a spreadsheet/notebook and logging all of your pulls so you know when you're due for a Mercy Rule legendary? This tab will show you the number of pulls of each shard type you've had since you pulled a given rarity, as well as your current summoning chances for that shard/rarity combination and most recent pull.

# FAQ

## Why is this not open source?
Because of *how* this application is designed and coded, there's enough risk that others could use its code for malicious purposes (such as cheating) in the game, and that is not something I want to facilitate. While these things could be done without this applications code, it requires a decent amount of work and internal knowledge of how the Unity Engine and il2cpp works to accomplish.

I do plan to release the libraries I've created for code generation using il2js metadata at a later date once I can generalize them further than they are today.
